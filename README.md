## Status

MVP 3 is bootstrapped from the audited `Side_Project_CPG_Tree_MVP` baseline.
The inherited implementation demonstrates deterministic execution and source
traceability, but its rules are not yet a clinically approved connected flow.
The next milestone is an LLM-assisted, evidence-bound **Candidate Graph** for
clinical review. See
[docs/MVP3_TECHNICAL_HANDOFF.md](docs/MVP3_TECHNICAL_HANDOFF.md).

This is a research prototype, not a production clinical decision-support
system, and does not replace clinical judgment.

## About

- Generic, protocol-agnostic infrastructure for protocol ingestion, extraction,
  knowledge representation, deterministic rule evaluation, and traceability.
- Initial protocol corpus: two institutional clinical protocols (`CT-PL-193`,
  `CT-PL-197`) kept locally under `data/01_raw/` and ignored by Git.
- Local-first: core functionality runs locally with Python 3.12 and uv.

## Tooling

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — environment and dependency management
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) — testing
- [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) — linting and formatting
- [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) — static type checking
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) — quality gates

## Development

```bash
make install_env      # sync the environment and install pre-commit hooks
uv run pytest         # run tests
make check            # run the full quality gate (pre-commit)
```

## CLI

The MVP ships a local, deterministic command-line interface over the committed
knowledge packages (no server, no database, no cloud):

```bash
uv run python -m cpg_tree --help
uv run python -m cpg_tree list
uv run python -m cpg_tree inspect CT-PL-197 v06
uv run python -m cpg_tree rules CT-PL-197 v06 --rule rule_t1_itu_baja
uv run python -m cpg_tree provenance CT-PL-197 v06 --rule rule_t1_itu_baja
uv run python -m cpg_tree tree CT-PL-197 v06
uv run python -m cpg_tree validate CT-PL-197 v06
uv run python -m cpg_tree evaluate CT-PL-197 v06 case.json
uv run python -m cpg_tree visualize CT-PL-197 v06
```

- `case.json` maps variable ids to `string | number | boolean | null`; `null`
  means explicitly missing information (evaluated as UNKNOWN, never FALSE).
- Every data command accepts `--json` for deterministic machine-readable output.
- Exit codes: `0` success, `1` operational/input failure, `2` usage error.
- Protocol artifacts are discovered from `protocols/<id>/<version>/package.yaml`;
  a new protocol becomes available by adding its versioned artifact directory.
- All output is derived from the canonical packages and the deterministic rule
  engine. Actions are declarative and are never executed; multiple `PRESCRIBE`
  actions on one rule are source-declared alternatives, never a selection.
  This is a research prototype, not clinical advice.

`visualize` generates a self-contained static HTML presentation of a protocol
into `data/08_reporting/<PROTOCOL_ID>-<VERSION>.html` (open it locally in any
browser). One document contains three views with anchor navigation:

1. **Clinical Pathway View (Vía clínica de decisión)** — a deterministic
   static SVG pathway built exclusively from the D2.5 reconciliation contract
   (`evaluation/pathway/<id>-<version>-reconciliation.yaml`; pass
   `--reconciliation PATH` to override). Only source-reconciled FLOW
   relationships become Rule-to-Rule edges; branch contexts, terminals, and
   badges are presentation-only. Conflicts, gaps, and inferred structures
   remain explicitly visible and are never resolved by the presentation.
2. **Clinical Knowledge View** — the deterministic static SVG knowledge map
   (no JavaScript, no external resources): one visual node per rule with its
   `applies_to` / condition / exceptions, the engine's static
   TRUE/FALSE/UNKNOWN outcome lanes (never a live patient evaluation),
   declarative actions (alternatives never selected), and a provenance line.
3. **Technical View** — the existing detailed rule cards with expressions,
   provenance chains, and shared-expression badges.

Every Rule node links to its Technical View card and back. Rules are grouped
into presentation sections by an optional sidecar manifest
(`protocols/<id>/<version>/visualization.yaml`); sections are display
groupings only — they do not represent clinical workflow or execution order.
The manifest may additionally declare an optional `graph` key
(`entry_points` + `edges` with `kind: reference`) for presentation-only
connectors between rule nodes. Connectors are visual references
("referencia de presentación"), never clinical dependencies or workflow; the
committed NAC and ITU manifests intentionally declare zero edges. The
clinical views are derived presentations: they do not constitute clinical
validation, and `package.yaml` remains the single source of truth for all
clinical content.

## Evaluation evidence

- `docs/mvp-closure.md` — MVP closure report: acceptance criteria, evidence
  matrix (reproducible via `inspect --json`), five engine outcomes, fidelity
  accounting (extracted / normalized / inferred / unresolved), limitations.
- `evaluation/cases/` — committed synthetic demonstration cases (non-patient
  data), one per engine outcome where reachable:

```bash
uv run python -m cpg_tree evaluate CT-PL-193 evaluation/cases/CT-PL-193/v09/nac_matched.json
uv run python -m cpg_tree evaluate CT-PL-197 evaluation/cases/CT-PL-197/v06/itu_excepted.json
```
