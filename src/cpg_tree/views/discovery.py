"""Generic protocol artifact discovery and loading.

Protocols are discovered from the committed artifact tree:

    protocols/<protocol_id>/<version>/package.yaml

Discovery is purely directory-driven: no registry, no builder imports, and no
protocol-specific knowledge. The same mechanism serves every protocol, and a
new protocol becomes visible by adding its versioned artifact directory.
