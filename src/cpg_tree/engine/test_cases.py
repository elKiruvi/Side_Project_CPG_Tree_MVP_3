"""Test-case harness built on top of the deterministic engine.

``run_test_cases`` is testing tooling, not part of the runtime engine: the
core evaluator never depends on ``TestCase``. It projects ``RuleOutcome`` onto
``TruthValue`` to compare against ``TestCase.expected_results``:

- MATCHED -> TRUE
- NOT_MATCHED, NOT_APPLICABLE, EXCEPTED -> FALSE
- INDETERMINATE -> UNKNOWN

Known limitation of this projection: EXCEPTED and NOT_APPLICABLE collapse
into FALSE because ``TestCase.expected_results`` only supports TruthValue.
The full outcome remains available on each ``RuleEvaluation``.

TRY004 is disabled for this module on purpose: harness configuration errors
raise ValueError subclasses by API contract, and the test suite asserts them
explicitly.
